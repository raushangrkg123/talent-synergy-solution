                                        <p>But what are the consequences of neglecting strategic talent development?</p>

                                            <li><strong>M&A Mayhem:</strong> Mergers without a clear plan for <a href="https://www.iqneiform.fi/post/talent-integration" target="_blank">talent integration </a> and skill gap analysis lead to confusion, redundancy, and low morale. This translates to high turnover and hinders the overall success of the merger.</li>
                                            <li><strong>New Hire Hiccups:</strong> Inadequate onboarding leaves new hires struggling to adapt, leading to frustration and potentially early departures. This translates to higher recruitment and training costs.</li>

                                            <li><strong>Unaddressed Underperformance:</strong> Ignoring underperformance fosters a culture of mediocrity, demotivates high performers, and can lead to legal problems or missed deadlines impacting client relationships.</li>
                                        </ul>
