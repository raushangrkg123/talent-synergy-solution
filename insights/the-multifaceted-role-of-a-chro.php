By focusing on strategic leadership, CEO partnership, C-suite collaboration, board influence, employee advocacy, data and analytics, and adaptability, and by implementing the corresponding strategic action plans, CHROs can navigate their expanding roles with confidence and impact. Ignoring any one of these areas can undermine their overall effectiveness, underscoring the necessity for a well-rounded strategic approach to their leadership.</p>
