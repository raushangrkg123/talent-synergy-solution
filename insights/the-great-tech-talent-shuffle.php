While headlines often focus on layoffs and restructuring, two pivotal trends are quietly reshaping the landscape: the decentralization of tech talent and the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI). These interrelated forces are creating both opportunities and challenges for companies and professionals alike.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5><strong>The Rise of Tier 2 and Tier 3 Tech Hubs</strong></h5>
                                        <p>For decades, the tech industry has been concentrated in a few major metropolitan areas, often referred to as Tier 1 cities. Bangalore, Delhi, and Mumbai in India, and Silicon Valley in the United States, have been synonymous with innovation and opportunity. However, a paradigm shift is underway. <br> <br>

                                            A growing number of tech professionals are opting for a better work-life balance, lower living costs, and a stronger sense of community by returning to their hometowns or relocating to smaller cities. This phenomenon, often termed "reverse migration," is fueling the emergence of Tier 2 and Tier 3 tech hubs.
                                        </p>
